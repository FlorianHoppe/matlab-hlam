matlab-hlam
===========

My dissertation and the code of the Hierarchical Network of Locally Arranged Models. It's a supervised learning algorithm to solve regression problems.


* SETUP: Add the 'hlam' directory and all subdirectories
  to your MATLAB PATH variable to use this package.

* Open the file 'example/example.m' and apply MATLAB's 'Publish To'
  utility to generate a HTML- or LaTeX-formatted documentation, or type:

    >> open( publish( 'hlam_example.m', struct( 'evalCode', false ) ) )

  at your MATLAB prompt after adding all directories to
  the MATLAB PATH variable.

* Example configurations, training and test data sets are
  available in 'example/networks.mat'.
